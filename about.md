    <p>Hello! I am a PhD student at University of Cambridge Department of Computer Science and Technology working with <a href="https://svr-sk818-web.cl.cam.ac.uk/keshav/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Prof. Srinivasan Keshav</a>. My research interests are applied remote sensing and machine learning in the natural environment. I am also broadly interested in environmental and technology policy.</p>

    <p>Prior to Cambridge, I received my masters from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and my bachelors from Vanderbilt University.</p>
